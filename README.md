# PenTest_Report Activity
PenTest Report produced as homework for the module, Penetration Testing II of USYD CyberSec Bootcamp (Week 17 of 22)

The activity was performed within AzureLabs; utilising one Kali VM and one Windows 10 workstation.

"In this activity, you will play the role of an independent penetration tester hired by GoodCorp Inc. to perform security tests against their CEO’s workstation.

The CEO claims to have passwords that are long and complex and therefore unhackable.

You are tasked with gaining access to the CEO's computer and using a Meterpreter session to search for two files that contain the strings recipe and seceretfile."

SCOPE:
The scope of this engagement is limited to the CEO's workstation only.
You are not permitted to scan any other IP addresses or exploit anything other than the CEO's IP address.
The CEO has a busy schedule and cannot have the computer offline for an extended period of time. Therefore, denial of service and brute force attacks are prohibited.
After you gain access to the CEO’s computer, you may read and access any file, but you cannot delete them. Nor are you allowed to make any configurations changes to the computer.
	
Since you've already been provided access to the network, OSINT won't be necessary.
